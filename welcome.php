    <p>Childrens Hospital Foundations Australia (Childrens Hospitals) is a national fundraising organisation supporting
        Australias five major childrenâ€™s hospital foundations. Through a single gateway, we uniquely provide access to a
        national network of childrens hospitals providing over 1.65 million treatments for children each year.

        Our partner hospitals treat over 4,500 infants and children everyday. Some need a stitch and a hug while others
        rely on ground-breaking research and the latest medical technology to survive.

        Through corporate partnerships, we fund life-saving equipment, medical research and essential services not
        supported by government or a hospitals standard operating costs.

        This funding is shared equally across all five partner foundations ensuring every Australian child has access to
        the best possible research, medical technology and paediatric care.</p>
