# TCH
Uni project (Semester 1, year 2). Townsville Children's Hospital doctor/admin system.

Assignment completed together with four other students at Queensland University of Technology.
NOT ALL CODE IS MINE. I was doing (mostly) backend on this project, so a lot of the PHP is mine, and quite a bit of the JavaScript, but not much of the styling.

All details can be found in [the assignment report](FULL_REPORT.pdf)
